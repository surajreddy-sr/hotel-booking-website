This project is a fully functional front-end Hotel Booking System where users can create an account, log in, browse hotels, and download a booking receipt.

🔹 How the Website Works
▶️ Main Entry Page: loginpage.html

The user first opens Create Account and registers.

User details (name, email, password) are saved using localStorage, so the account stays even after closing the browser.

After successful registration → the user can log in from loginpage.html.

After login → user is redirected to the Home / Hotel Listing page.

The user can select a hotel, choose dates, number of guests, and confirm booking.

When the booking is confirmed → the website automatically generates and downloads a booking receipt (.txt file).
